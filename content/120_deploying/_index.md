# Publishing Our App

The AWS Amplify Console is a continuous delivery and hosting service for web applications. Connect to your code repository and your web application is deployed in a single workflow, on every code commit. 

AWS Amplify Console supports common Single Page App (SPA) frameworks (e.g. React, Angular, Vue.js, Ionic, Ember), as well as static-site generators like Gatsby, Eleventy, Hugo, VuePress, and Jekyll.

We will now look at how we can deploy our Gatsby site to Amplify Console.
