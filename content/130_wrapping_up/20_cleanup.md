### Deleting your Amplify Console App

In the Amplify console go to the app you want to delete. In the top right hand corner, select actions then selected delete and follow the instructions.

The S3 Buckets that Amplify created will not be automatically deleted. To delete these buckets:

1. Open the [S3 console](https://s3.console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home) 

2. Click the **Date created** column to sort the buckets with the newest ones on top

3. Delete any buckets created by Amplify Console
