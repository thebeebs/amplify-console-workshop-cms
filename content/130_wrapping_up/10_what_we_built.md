You have learnt the basics of Gatsby and Amplify Console.

Here's a reminder of everything we accomplished. We:

- Started with a simple Gatsby Starter Website

- Added basic pages

- Added Markdown pages and listed them on the front page

- Connected the site to WordPress

- Published the site using Amplify Console


The website is entirely static, which means it's extremely cost efficient, scalable, and highly available thanks to services from AWS. 

Not bad for a few hours of work! 

Please give yourself a **huge pat on the back** for making it all the way to the end!
