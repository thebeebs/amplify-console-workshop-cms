## Install Node.js

Node.js is an environment that can run JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Gatsby is built with Node.js. To get up and running with Gatsby, you’ll need to have a recent version installed on your computer.

_Note: Gatsby's minimum supported Node.js version is Node 8, but feel free to use a more recent version._

### ⌚ Download Node.js

Visit the [**Node.js site**](https://nodejs.org/) and follow the instructions to download and install the recommended version for your operating system. Once you have followed the installation steps, make sure everything was installed properly:

### Check your Node.js installation

1.  Open up your terminal.
2.  Run `node --version`. (If you’re new to the command line, “run `command`” means “type `node --version` in the command prompt, and hit the Enter key”. From here on, this is what we mean by “run `command`”).
3.  Run `npm --version`.

The output of each of those commands should be a version number. Your versions may not be the same as those shown below! If entering those commands doesn’t show you a version number, go back and make sure you have installed Node.js.

## Familiarize yourself with npm

npm is a JavaScript package manager. A package is a module of code that you can choose to include in your projects. If you just downloaded and installed Node.js, npm was installed with it!

## Install Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency. When you install a Gatsby "starter" site, Gatsby uses Git behind the scenes to download and install the required files for your starter. You will need to have Git installed to set up your first Gatsby site.

The steps to download and install Git depend on your operating system. Follow the guide for your system:

- [Install Git on macOS](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#mac-os-x)
- [Install Git on Windows](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#windows)
- [Install Git on Linux](https://www.atlassian.com/git/tutorials/install-git#linux)

> 💡 You will not need to know Git to complete this tutorial, but it is a very useful tool. If you are interested in learning more about version control, Git, and GitHub, check out GitHub's [Git Handbook](https://guides.github.com/introduction/git-handbook/).

## Using the Gatsby CLI

The Gatsby CLI tool lets you quickly create new Gatsby-powered sites and run commands for developing Gatsby sites. It is a published npm package.

The Gatsby CLI is available via npm and should be installed globally by running `npm install -g gatsby-cli`.

To see the commands available to run `gatsby --help`.

> 💡 If you are unable to successfully run the Gatsby CLI due to a permissions issue, you may want to check out the [npm docs on fixing permissions](https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions), or [this guide](https://github.com/sindresorhus/guides/blob/master/npm-global-without-sudo.md).

## Set up a code editor

A code editor is a program designed specifically for editing computer code. There are many great ones out there.

> If you haven't worked with a code editor before, we recommend [**VS Code**](https://code.visualstudio.com/).

 If you choose to use VS Code, visit the [VS Code site](https://code.visualstudio.com/#alt-downloads) and download the version appropriate for your platform.
